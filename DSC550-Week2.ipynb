He hardly has he track record of someone trying to railroad workers for corporate interests so there must have been something he felt was hugely important to use so much political capital on something like TPP. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe TPP could have been better (it certainly seems so) yet maybe it was the best Obama could manage given the many and varied interests at play.

While it tends towards the truth, due to the pressure for ratings to keep eyeballs, TV media will play up the outrageous aspects if there is a shred of truth to it. Best I can tell, the violent Bernie convention narrative began with TV news media. This meant the people editing content had an incentive (better TV ratings for more ad revenue) to cut the only video showing the chair with the guy putting it down. Instead, they cut it short right before he puts it down.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, a lot of these narratives (including the Bernie bros one) come out of our need for 24/7 info, which encourages our news media to try and be the first on the scene info wise, which means they rely on less than reliable sources.

It has a format that people tend to follow. \\\\nBut here is what happened at the first debate when the idea of job creation was brought up, Hillary pivoted to climate change. \\\\nHolt asked, \\' Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You\\'ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you\\'ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\\'\\\\n\\\\nAnd Donald replied in Donald fashion. Then Hillary was offered her time to comment.\\\\n\\'Independent experts have looked at what I\\'ve proposed and looked at what Donald\\'s proposed, and basically they\\'ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\\\\n\\\\nThey\\'ve looked at my plans and they\\'ve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.\\' She then pivoted to climate change.\\\\n\\\\\"Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it\\'s real.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDonald \\\\\"I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\\\\\"\\\\nHillary \\\\\" I think science is real.\\\\\"\\\\nDonald \\\\\" I do not say that.\\\\\"\\\\nHillary \\\\\"And I think it\\'s important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here\\'s what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That\\'s a lot of jobs; that\\'s a lot of new economic activity.\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we\\'re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we\\'ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThat\\'s the first debate where she had to go out of her way to make a point on climate change. \\\\n\\\\nDuring second debate, Anderson Cooper did talk about climate change.\\\\n\\\\nShe said the following. \\\\n\\\\\"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\\\\n\\\\nBut I also want to be sure that we don\\\\u2019t leave people behind. That\\\\u2019s why I\\\\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\\\\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\\\\u2019ve got to do something for them. But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively. And that\\\\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\\\\\" \\\\n\\\\nShe had just 2 min to stash in some pandering to what she cleary identify as her weakness, and at the same time begging people to go to the fucking website to read. \\\\n\\\\nIn the third debate, Wallace asked her about how her view on the government spending and etc etc would affect America, and she pivoted again to climate change. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Well I think the middle class thrives, America thrives. So my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high wage countries and I believe we should. \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHere is the pivot. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"New jobs in clean energy. Not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business, that\\\\u2019s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSo again, it wasn\\'t like she is ignoring the issue, but she can only do so much if the moderator is asking the wrong questions. She has to address the issues that were raised, and she has to kind of shore up on some of the white working class support, so she did the best she could have done in my opinion. \\\\n\\\\nAnd don\\'t fucking pretend there wasn\\'t talk of policy. There were simply more character attacks. Were the Clinton camps lazy in deflection on these character attacks whenever someone say \\'but email\\' or \\'bengazi\\' or \\'pay to play?\\' Sure, but media was shoving these shit out because people were eating these shit in.\"}',\n",
